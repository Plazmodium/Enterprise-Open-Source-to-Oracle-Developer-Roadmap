# Enterprise Open Source to Oracle Developer Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap guides open source enterprise developers through upskilling in Oracle technologies. The journey begins with open source foundation courses to strengthen core skills, then transitions to Oracle certifications. 

**Time Commitment**: 10-20 hours/week  
**Total Duration**: 6-12 months  
**Cost**: Open source courses are free; Oracle exams are $245 each (Associate/Professional levels)

| Introduction to Linux | LFS101 | 15-20 hours | Command-line, scripting essentials | edX | Free |

**Why Start Here**: Oracle often runs on Linux. These skills are essential for Oracle admin/dev tasks and OCI deployments.

### Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Courses

| Course Name | Code | Duration | Focus Area | Platform | Cost |
|-------------|------|----------|------------|----------|------|
| Introduction to Kubernetes | LFS158 | 15-20 hours | Container orchestration | CNCF Site | Free |
| Cloud Native Fundamentals | - | 10-15 hours | Microservices, CI/CD | CNCF Site | Free |

**Why These Matter**: Directly applicable to OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) and cloud-native app development.

### Additional Open Source Resources

**Recommended Sequence**:
1. Complete LFS101 (Linux basics) first
2. Take LFS200 (cloud concepts)
3. Move to LFS158 (Kubernetes)
4. Supplement with SQL and database courses as needed
